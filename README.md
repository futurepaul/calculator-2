## Calulator 2

With most calculators, you provide the data and the algorithm. To get the area of a circle, you enter the radius (the data, in this example), you square it, and then you multiply that by pi. Most of what you just did was algorithm input. With [Calculator 2](https://calculator2.com/), you only provide the data and the app provides the algorithm. So now, instead of remembering algorithms, you just pick them from a list, insert your variables, and you're done. It's a "declarative" rather than an "imperative" calculator, if that makes sense.
